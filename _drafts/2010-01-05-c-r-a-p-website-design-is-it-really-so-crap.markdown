excerpt: If someone is telling you that your design is crap, they’re actually giving
  you a positive reinforcement! What that actually means? C.R.A.P. stands for <strong>Contrast</strong>,
  <strong>Repetition</strong>, <strong>Alignment</strong>, <strong>Proximity</strong>.
  Good web design practice is to consider and rate your design in terms of &acute;crap&acute;
  before we do any coding and things get more complicated to apply any aditional major
  changes.

<h2>C.R.A.P. Website Design principles explained</h2>

<h3>Contrast</h3>
<p class="b">Elements that aren’t the same should be very different so they stand out, making them &acute;a little bit different&acute; confuses the visitors into seeing a relation that doesn&acute;t exist. Strong contrast between page elements allows the user&acute;s eye to flow from one to another down the page instead of creating a sea of similarity that’s boring and not communicative.</p>

<h3>Repetition</h3>
<p class="b">Repeat styles down the page for a cohesive feel &ndash; do style related elements the same way in different areas, continue that trend for consistency.</p>
      
<h3>Alignment</h3>
<p class="b">Everything on the page needs to be visually connected to something else, nothing should be out of place or distinct from all other design elements.</p>
      
<h3>Proximity</h3>
<p class="b">Proximity creates related meaning: elements that are related should be grouped together, whereas separate design elements should have enough space in between to communicate they are different.</p>
      
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>
<p>The C.R.A.P. principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity) are good ways to double-check your design work. When I think about my design I consider it as a crap and that reminds me about those principles. To find out more about C.R.A.P. design principles, check out the book called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321534042?ie=UTF8&tag=pmde09-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0321534042" title="The Non-Designer's Design Book">The Non&ndash;Designer&acute;s Design Book</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=pmde09-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0321534042" /> by Robin Williams.</p>
<p>That&acute;s it! I hope you like it.</p>
