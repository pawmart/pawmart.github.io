<h2>Semantic HTML5</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

...In addition, the use of Semantic HTML5 makes it easier for screen readers to interpret web page content, thus allowing visually impaired web browsers a better online experience.  Developments are being made to allow iDevices to view video by converting Flash to Semantic HTML5, which is browser based rather than plugin based.

Semantic HTML relates the expression of the message of your website through the content and the tags coded within a page.  The content is the message that you relate to your audience via words, images and media.  The tags will display your message by providing the structure of your website, setting the tone and effecting the overall functionality and appearance of your website.

The purpose of SEO is to assist search engine spiders with categorizing your web page so that it can be found and listed by search engines properly.  They are technologically less advanced than devices like a screen reader, but semantic HTML helps to provide the additional structure necessary to assist search engine spiders with the task of categorizing your website properly and allowing people to find you online through the use of tags. 


<h2>Improvements with HTML5</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

With HTML5 the inclusion of media is browser based rather than plugin based, making downloads significantly faster and eliminating buffering.  Videos are also made more searchable and are indexed easier with the HTML5 media elements.  In addition, there is a new canvas element that allows you to create drawings, charts and graphics.  This JavaScript based element is also browser based and has the same benefits as the media elements in terms of download speeds. 

To access and store data, HTML5 utilizes JavaScript and only uses data when it is requested. This eliminates the use of cookies that congest server requests.  Additionally, with HTML5 there is an increase in functionality for forms and their use with mobile devices. 


<h2>The Importance of Website Structure</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

How your website is structured will determine how well the search engines can determine where to find certain topics on your pages.  Using semantic HTML can improve the quality of the search engine categorization results and some specific elements of website structure will be discussed at length. How well your website is structured will also help determine download speeds and lend to the appeal of your message.


<h2>What’s in a Page? </h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

A page consists of a title, one or more headings and content.  This content can contain text, graphics, tables and images.  All these types of information have their own designated tag(s) that allow you to control and manipulate data to make it look attractive, convey a message, and make it readable by search engines and devices.  One important aspect of page structure is headings. 


<h2>Headings and Semantic HTML5</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

HTML heading tags are used to define a website’s main topics and are used to help give your keywords more distinction with search engines.  They help form a structure to your website by outlining main points to your page for viewers and search engines. 

A semantically proper website will contain headings and subheadings in order to help users and search engines determine the topics of your pages.  Headings range in size from h1 being the largest to h6 as the smallest.  The size of your headings is a personally aesthetic choice, but most home pages only contain one h1 heading, unless it contains a series of articles as a blog does. 

<div class="hot">
<img width="622" height="231 alt="Semantic HTML5 & SEO Friendliness" src="http://www.pawelmartuszewski.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/html.jpg">
</div>

On blog pages, having a lot of h1 headings for your article topics is good for SEO purposes.  Some semanticists suggest that heading order should be like an outline, with one h1, two h2s and so on.  But again, there are no set rules to heading usage and it’s really a matter of personal choice and the message you wish to relate to your target audience.

It is not uncommon for web designers using Semantic HTML to take the website’s name in the title tag and place it in an h1 header on the home page.  On other pages, sometimes a larger heading with the website’s title will be placed on the page, or designers will use the span tag within the text to hook off the title text and have the ability to manipulate the look and appearance of the text within the content. 

There is one thing to know about using Semantic HTML and SEO friendliness; search engines use the words placed in headings along with textual content in order to determine the topic of a page.  The words that are placed in headings are scrutinized more closely for topics by search engines, so it is advisable that you place the main/root keyword of your website in at least one h1 heading and place secondary keywords in smaller subheadings. 


<h2>Using Images with Semantic HTML5</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

The image tag is used to place images on website pages.  If an image you are using serves a specific purpose or function to the website, rather than being used for aesthetic purposes, it is common Semantic HTML5 protocol to use the alt attribute to describe the image with text so that the viewer can follow the flow of the website better.  If your image is simply for ornamental purposes, there is no need to use the alt tag.

Some designers want their text to be placed in the form of an image for aesthetic reasons.  They do this by including the normal text within the document and hide it with the image using CSS and by indenting the text.  This is done to include the full website experience for visually impaired people who are using screen readers.  Also, search engines cannot read the text in images.  If you should elect to use this style of design for your website, make sure that your normal HTML text matches your image text in order to retain search engine ranking values. 


<h2>New Graphics Tag</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

The canvas tag is new to Semantic HTML5 and is used as a container for graphics.  Using this tag requires the use of a script to paint the graphics, charts and drawings.  One good feature of the canvas tag is that any text that is written between these tags will appear if a browser or device does not support HTML5, which makes it similar to the alt tag.


<h2>Semantically Correct Tables</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

<div class="hot">
<img width="622" height="231 alt="Semantic HTML5 & SEO Friendliness" src="http://www.pawelmartuszewski.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/htmlgrid.jpg">
</div>

Tables are used to display tabular data.  To improve your table’s semantic value, use table heading that include keywords to increase SEO.  Properly sectioning your table with thead, tbody and tfoot will make the data in the table easier to read by having the proper amount of space between sections. Finally, it is good practice to include a caption that contains keywords in it as well. 


<h2>A Bit About Microdata</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

Microdata are used to collect information such as events, news, reviews and contact information from websites to allow search engines like Google to create Rich Snippets that afford the web user a better browsing experience.  It is similar to but simpler than Microformats. 


<h2>Final Thoughts...</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

Using Semantic HTML5 will allow the creation of pages that are more accessible to search engines, screen readers and mobile devices.  It will also provide a better browsing experience with media features that allow for faster downloads with no buffering.  Search engines will be able determine what the topic of your website is and, when combined with a good website structure, will allow you to increase your rankings on the World Wide Web.
