This incredible service looks very promising! I decided to give away <strong>20 invitations</strong> to <strong>Google Wave</strong> Service, to my existing or new <strong>subscribers</strong>, as a big THANK YOU for being with me and supporting my work and passion!

<h2>What is Google Wave</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>
&acute;<a href="http://wave.google.com/help/wave/about.html" title="Google Wave Invites">Google Wave</a> is an online tool for real-time communication and collaboration. A wave can be both a conversation and a document where people can discuss and work together using richly formatted text, photos, videos, maps, and more.&acute; (<a href="http://wave.google.com/help/wave/about.html">About Google Wave</a>)
<h2>Google Wave Preview</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>
<object width="653" height="396"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/v_UyVmITiYQ&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/v_UyVmITiYQ&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="653" height="396"></embed></object>
<div class="cl">&nbsp;</div>
<h2>How to get the Invitation</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>
<ul style="padding: 5px 0px 0px 25px;">
<li style="line-height:22px;padding-bottom:20px;font-size:13px;">1. Simply <a href="#hd">subscribe to my newsletter</a> (if you haven´t already). Get notified about new articles and tutorials. I will NOT give your e–mail address to anyone! I promise!</li>
<li style="line-height:22px;padding-bottom:20px;font-size:13px;">2. Additionally <a href="#comment">comment on this post</a> to let me know that you are interested in getting the invite.</li>
</ul>

<img title="google wave invites giveaway" alt="google wave invites giveaway" src="http://www.pawelmartuszewski.co.uk/artls/google_wave/google_invitation.png"/>
<div class="cl">&nbsp;</div>
I will then compare your email address from the post comment and will check if you are my subscriber. Then I will select <strong> lucky subscribers</strong>. Once comment is closed, give away is done!
