To really be able to serve clients in their branding needs, you as a designer should at least familiarize yourself with core brand concepts. While often branding design seems second nature to designers, knowing the elements of a brand will only help in taking your branding designs to the next level.

<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>

<p>The American Marketing Association defines a brand as:<br />
<blockquote style="border-left:3px solid #555;padding-left:14px;margin-bottom:15px;">
<p style="font-style:italic;">A   name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one   seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers. The   legal term for brand is trademark. A brand may identify one item, a   family of items, or all items of that seller. If used for the firm as a whole, the preferred term is trade name.
</p>
<p><em>-<a href="http://www.marketingpower.com/_layouts/Dictionary.aspx?dLetter=B">“Brand” definition from AMA website</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Differentiation.   That’s the key to branding. It is setting your client apart “as   distinct from those of other sellers.” You do this through logos, design   schemes, color palettes and other tools you have at your disposal as a   graphic designer. </p>

<h2>Established Brands</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
<p>If your client already has a brand established, then much of your work is done. But you still need to be intimately familiar with their brand. If you're lucky, the client already has a brand guideline that will carefully define logo placements, colors in CMYK and RGB, and fonts, to name a few. Otherwise, you will have to rely on your powers of observation to carefully align your graphic design work with their brand. </p>
<h2>Developing Branding</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
<p>When you do have the opportunity to build a brand, you have an important role to play and due diligence to perform. A few questions you have to ask include:</p>

<ul style="padding:5px;">
  <li style="line-height: 22px; padding-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px;" class="b"> - What does the competition's brand look like? You have to differentiate your client, after all.</li>
  <li style="line-height: 22px; padding-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px;" class="b"> - What are the industry expectations of brands? Do they typically use a company name as a brand of its own or is a simple logo standard? While you do want to differentiate, you have to balance going too far. </li>
  <li style="line-height: 22px; padding-bottom: 20px; font-size: 13px;"  class="b"> - Does the client already have an idea of where they want to go with their brand? </li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have answered these questions, you can start building out a branding package. </p>
<h2>Branding Elements</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
<p>Brands include many elements, but the primary are logos, organization's name, color palettes, and font/typography selection. These elements help establish brand recognition with customers. Other, sub-branding components may be voice, key people (brand spokesperson, such a Geico's Gecko), genre (think funny beer commercials), and the like. </p>

<h2>Branding Guidelines</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
<p>Once you have developed a clear branding package based upon the primary brand elements, take the time to develop a branding guideline. Define each piece of the brand in clear terms for your client. This not only helps your client in the future, it helps keep you on track. </p>
<p>Branding guides should include any graphical elements like the logo and organization's name. You may want to establish how each should be displayed, such as what kind of background they may be used against, how much whitespace is minimum, or how each should be positioned relative to the edge of a page. </p>
<p>You should alse include examples of font faces, headings, and other typographical elements. These will ensure a consistent treatment throughout any literature or marketing collateral used later. </p>
<p>Lastly, include defined color palettes. If you can, stick with Pantone colors. Otherwise, define colors in RGB, CMYK, and hexadecimal for web use. When necessary, explain when certain colors should or should not be used with each other - red on blue, for example. </p>
<h2>Branding Collateral</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
<p>Standard branding collateral includes business cards, letterhead, envelopes, website banners, brochures, and catalogs. Each has their own unique look-and-feel. With each piece of collateral, stick with your branding guidelines. Avoid the temptation to use alternative fonts on business cards unless you are willing to update the branding guidelines. </p>
<p>Be consistent with the collateral. Consumers are exposed to so many brands that it takes more and more exposures to develop brand recognition. The more consistent you are with your branding collateral, the more likely the consumer will remember your brand as fewer exposures will be needed when compared to brands that are inconsistent. </p>
