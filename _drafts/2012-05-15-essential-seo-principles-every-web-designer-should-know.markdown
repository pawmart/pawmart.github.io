I don’t buy it. Designers and developers are creative enough, and certainly tech savvy enough, to adapt their tools and habits to make a site design eminently search-engine friendly. It’s simply a matter of buying into the SEO web design principles that are often neglected.

<h2>Designing for SEO from the Bones Outward<h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
Building a sensible link structure that’s both scalable and easy to navigate has tangible benefits to SEO. A bot is more likely to miss URLs on a site with an ad hoc structure. Having a roadmap for the crawlers to follow doesn’t hurt, either. Setting up an XML sitemap with the proper syntax essentially does that and helps bots get back on track if they run into trouble while moving through your site.

URL optimization is also something that is easier to make happen when building from the ground up. Keeping session IDs out of your URLs, for example, removes a common stumbling block for engines trying to index the site. Likewise, filling your URLs with relevant keywords is a lot better than simply assigning the page an automatically generated number. Some content management systems, like Wordpress, will still generate portions of the URL based on page titles, and it’s worth the effort to optimize URLs for important landing pages on your site. And you should be using the “rel=canonical” meta tag to help bots ignore duplicated pages; otherwise, you may see an impact on your rankings due to what the search engines see as a mass of duplicate content.

<h2>Knowing How Flash Impacts SEO<h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
Despite the now lukewarm Flash vs. HTML5 wars, Flash isn’t going away anytime soon, and it really does offer some high-quality deliverables for designers and site owners who want something really pretty. You can use flash without sabotaging SEO, but you have to pay attention.

Search engines don’t care about flash animations or splash pages; they live on HTML. If you’re using Flash and images instead of text, you’re missing the opportunity to have the textual content of those elements indexed by Google. A beautiful flash page doesn’t get seen by anybody if it doesn’t show up in organic listings.

Even worse, links to your site that are embedded in flash can’t be accessed by bots, which will effectively shield most of the site (including homepages, where link juice is heavily concentrated) from being crawled and indexed. Since it’s a lot easier for web crawlers to index a link structure by starting at the home page, links embedded in Flash are is a serious roadblock to getting the most pages indexed. If you do use Flash, don’t use it for generating animations in your menu bar or other navigation links. There are plenty of JavaScript libraries that will give you happy little animations while still letting the content there be indexed.

<h2>Making Loading Speed a Priority<h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
The big kids on the block are optimizing their servers and site designs to be the fastest loading, and it’s not just to avoid users clicking away from their sites. Bots care about speed, too, and a page that loads too slowly can impact your rankings. Some of that may not be within your control as a designer or developer, but you can work to make your pages as lightweight as possible by choosing smaller image file formats (the bulk of most pages, and another reason to go easy on Flash) and even using scripts to delay loading material and images below the fold.

<h2>Content, Content, Content<h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
A pretty design is all-too-often masking an utter lack of content that users will want to click to see (and keep clicking to find more). The new relevance of “rel=author” tags is showing us a new way that Google is trying to establish relevant authority of content by tying it to an actual person. As designers/developers, you have to be careful not to paint content creators (like myself) into corners with your design. I’m mostly talking about giving creators options (slideshows, infographics, interactive content), but that is also tied to the space available on a given page and the placement of elements. Be flexible is all I’m saying. Content is king, and that’s never going to change.
