<h2>Tell me about your work / company and your experience in Web Development. What do you do for living?</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

My work is primarily web design, but a lot of my clients also require matching branding such as print material (business cards, letterheads, brochures etc) which I also work on.  I work with a small network of freelancers so I can provide a complete solution to my clients (e-commerce and other development work).  I am a sole trader, under my company name, CG Inspired, which means I do all my own advertising, tax, billing and project management.

<h2>What existing web tools do you use (if any) while working and why / how often (generators, optimisers, etc.)?</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

I mainly use the following: 
•	Lorem ipsum generator during the design process for text filling 
•	sitemap generator for submitting new sites to search engines
•	privacy policy + copyright generator 
•	used to use an online web browser tester, but now use my own offline one
•	CSS compression
•	HTML tidy
•	Competitor backlink checker for SEO
•	Adwords keyword tool for SEO and keyword optimization

<h2>How this affects your job performance?</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

Saves me a lot of time, not sure what I’d do without some of them!

<h2>Are you satisfied with existing web tools available online?</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

Yes, although it took a while to find exactly what I required as there are so many derivatives of the same thing.  Some of them, especially link diagnosis are invaluable in providing really useful information.  

<h2>What you can say about customers you build applications for and their expectations (deadlines)?</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

Every customer is different, but on the whole, before even starting a project I get them to tell me if they have a deadline (some don’t have one at all), if they do I’ll tell them if I can get the work done in that space of time.  This eliminates any real problems about deadlines.  Like any service you pay good money for, clients are allowed to expect a decent, quality output on time – web design is no different.

<h2>What do you think about the idea of the service that would provide all necessary tools for you in a one place and how you would wish it to work?</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

This is an interesting idea.  It would have to provide the best of all the tools, if even one of the tools did a poorer job that you can get online, it would defeat the purpose of the service.  I’d also prefer if it to be offline – ie not SaaS as, although very useful, I wouldn’t want to pay a monthly fee, this could be impossible with online tools, perhaps a onetime purchase/license option.  Web designers can get pretty defensive about their favorite tools so I think it would be a tough nut to crack!  For tools like invoicing and project management there are some huge competitors that already do a great job for a price – basecamp, freshbooks, invoicing machine etc.  

<h2>What web tools would you like to use in your development processes? (in this service idea) </h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

1.	Lorem Ipsum Text Generator
2.	Sitemap Generator
3.	Random Password Generator
4.	Invoicing and Customers Management
5.	Privacy Policy Page Generator
6.	Cross –browser tester
7.	Google Checker – Search position of your website
8.	HTML Tidy Services
9.	CSS Tidy Services
10.	Online CSS Text Styler
11.	CSS developer playground – see what you get
12.	RSS personalized reader – your personal news updates
13.	CMS Services like CushyCMS
14.	Back link Checker


<h2>Thank you </h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

Thank you for your time and effort. It's been great to talk to you!
