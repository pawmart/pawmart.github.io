  content: nice post :) I agree with everything you have said, social media can be
    very time consuming too, that's the only downfall.

We can define 4 main social media types: blogs, social networking sites, forums and social bookmaking sites. Social Media sites helps to get direct traffic to your website and helps to build awareness about your website.

<div class="cl">&nbsp;</div>
<h2>Begin a Business Blog</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

If you will provide a great content on your blog, people are more likely to link to it. This will effect your page rank (increase) as soon as you host your blog under the same domain as your main website. 

Consistency and having something interesting to say are key.

<h2>Social Media Community involvement</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

Your should try <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">Linkedin</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>. Additionally you might want to get involved into social media share websites where you can share your articles, products or posts with others and <strong>promote your website</strong>. These include <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a>, <a href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a>, <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/">StumbleUpon</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/bookmarks/">Google Bookmarks</a> and many more <strong>social share platforms</strong>.

You might want to check my post about how to link to them directly. 
<p class="b">Check out: <a href="/web_design_articles/web-design/social-media-share-links-for-your-website-blog/">Social Media Share Links for your website / blog</a></p>

The biggest gain comes when other people mention you (which <strong>generates traffic</strong> to your site), link to you (which increases your <strong>PageRank</strong> and brings traffic), or bookmark you (which increases your <strong>PageRank</strong> and <strong>brings traffic</strong>).

Make sure your profile on social media sites is 'appropriate' and your links (website) are publicly visible. This will allow spiders to crawl them.

<h3>Reminder</h3>
<p class="b">Don’t join a community to spam them or talk all the time about the same product or service. You must know, that like any other community, <strong>you are expected to listen</strong> and <strong>comment</strong> and <strong>contribute</strong> for the good of others.</p>

<h2>Old School Promotion</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

You might want to try to promote your website on Forums and Discussion Lists. I recommend to check out <a href="groups.google.com">Google Groups</a> to find appropriate groups or search online for forums or blogs.

Avoid aggressive marketing and always try to contribute and be helpful. This will benefit you more then being involved into groups where they relay  mostly on span but not a real conversation.

<h2>Bookmarking your website</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in">&nbsp;</div></div>

Ask your visitors to bookmark your website. You might want to check <a href="http://www.addthis.com">AddThis Services</a>. This service might be helpful for you to provide a simple share system for your visitors on your website.

While you're at it, would you be so kind as to <strong>bookmark this page</strong> and <strong>share it</strong> on social media sites, using the buttons below? Thank you!
