If you're selling the goods of another brand, what will make you stand out from the crowd when 20/30/40 other companies are all selling the same product? Take a look below at a few tips to see some of the things that you can do to improve your pages.

<h2>1. Make The Title Include As Much Information As Possible</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>

<p>Try to put plenty of information in the title of the product to inform the customer exactly what they are looking at. If it comes in a certain size, put the size at the end. Include colours and what it is made from. This will give a better outline and will allow customers to see quickly what they are looking for.</p>

<p>While it is important to give plenty of information here, don't overcrowd the title to the point it becomes a description.</p>

<h2>2. Give A Good Description</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>

<p>The description is key to show the customer exactly what they could potentially be buying. This is the bit which will help the product sell better than any other. If the manufacturer of the product give a generic description, take this and turn it into something unique that is informative and interesting.</p>

<p>Get people excited about the products you are selling and conversions will increase. People are far more likely to buy from somewhere when what they're reading is engaging and insightful. You'll be more likely to get people linking back to the pages if they're interesting. Add this to the fact you are not publishing duplicate content that could be on dozens of other sites, and you could be onto a winner!</p>

<h2>3. Reviews &amp; Testimonials</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>

<p>A gentle nudge in the right direction from someone who has already bought and used this product is a great way of building trust with a potential customer. People like to hear about the product before they buy, so by putting reviews of products on your site, people can see what others have to say.</p>

<p>Testimonials are a great way of building a relationship with a customer base. If you don't already have any on your site, use an email list manager to distribute a short letter to previous customers, asking whether they would mind writing a couple of lines about your product.</p>

<p>Not only will this add content to your site, it will be a huge benefit to customers who are 50/50 whether to buy with you or not, possibly giving them the gentle nudge they may require! This article was written by Alight, a design agency in the UK. For more information please visit
