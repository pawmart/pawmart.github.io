This isn't limited to <strong>affiliate markets</strong> however, and many different types of navigation bars, or areas of the website that are somewhat unrelated or do not flow together can make a website very unattractive and may in fact increase your bounce rate (a trait that Google recently penalized in the recent "Panda" algorithm update).


In the Internet world, people want to know things right away. They want to be able to decide (think Bing and its "decision engine") right away without having to sort through too much literature. If your website isn't going to be the one to provide them with instant gratification - you can be sure that someone else's will.

This is very essential to remember if you are participating in affiliate marketing. People want to know their best options right away. They don't want to have to go through many different options and determine what is the best option for them after reading hours and hours worth of articles and reviews.

They want you to do the work for them. So as an affiliate marketer you should remember to give your visitors the best options right away, and if you have more options available - then leave those to the people who are willing to spend the amount of time it takes to go through all of these options. You should treat all of your "sub-par" options like you treat long-tail keywords. They shouldn't be your main focus - but they should be hanging in the background somewhere where they can be found by the right person at the right time.


One of the reasons that affiliate marketers make this mistake, whether they are trying to promote  <a href="http://www.inetzeal.com/">link building</a> service, or trying to get people to sign up for drop shipping and wholesaling companies, is that they think that more options will lead to more sales. This however is not the case as Ã¬the confused mind takes no action. Remembering this will help you make more money as affiliate marketer in all of your Internet ventures.
