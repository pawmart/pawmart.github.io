I write <a href="http://www.pawelmartuszewski.co.uk/web_design_tutorials/" title="Web Design Tutorials">tutorials</a> and <a href="http://www.pawelmartuszewski.co.uk/web_design_tutorials/web_design_articles/" title="Web Design Articles">articles</a> about <strong> web design</strong>, <strong>new techniques</strong>, <strong>tricks</strong>, <strong>SEO</strong> and everything you need to be successful online.

I created this website, <a href="http://www.pawelmartuszewski.co.uk" title="Web Design Tutorials - PM Design Blog">Pawel Martuszewski Design</a> in 2008 as a personal project. I have been a professional web designer since 2007,  working full time along with other <strong>freelance</strong> work. Additionally, I got a Honours Degree in IT Management for Business.

I learnt to design websites the hard way so that you don&acute;t have to. I hope that I can share my knowledge with you, and that my web <strong>tutorials</strong> and articles will help you find success online.

Please visit my <a href="http://portfolio.pawelmartuszewski.co.uk/" tittle="Pawel Martuszewski Portfolio">personal portfolio</a> to see some examples of my latest work.
