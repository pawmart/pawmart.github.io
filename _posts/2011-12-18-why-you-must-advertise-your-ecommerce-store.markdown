But with the ever changing market, what types of advertising are available to website owners?

<h2>Search Engine Optimisation</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
<p>Search engine optimisation or SEO as it's more commonly known, is the process in which you change your website and attract links so that you appear first in search engines for your keywords. This is usually a long process but can have massive advantages long term as the traffic driven costs you nothing. </p>

<p>There are many parts to SEO, both changes on your site and factors off your site and can be a difficult battle but an option well worth investigating.  </p>

<h2>Pay Per Click Advertising</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
<p>Pay Per Click or PPC is where you can bid on keywords then pay each time someone clicks on your ad. This is a quick and fairly safe bet to begin your advertising efforts. You can set a clear budget and scale up depending on your success and drive targeted traffic to your website. </p>

<p>PPC is the flip side of SEO, you target the same keywords but instead of achieving the natural rankings, you "skip the queue" and pay for the clicks.   </p>

<h2>Social Media Advertising</h2> 
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
<p>Social media websites are now entangled with everyday life. Millions of hours are spent every day on these sites and they too offer a Pay Per Click model which can be used to drive targeted traffic to your website. </p>

<p>Not only do they have this facility but you can also grow a natural fan base on these sites which you can market to. This fan base can provide valuable feedback on your site but also share your site with their friends. If you create an attract offer or something unique then this can snow ball into a viral frenzy and once again, get your website out there. </p>

<h2>Email Marketing</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
<p>This won't be applicable for those just starting their website but once your site has been running a while and you have collected emails of subscribers or customers then you can email these people updates and the latest offers. They say it's much harder to find new customers than the ones you already have and no place is this truer than online. </p> 

<p>These are just a few of the techniques you can use to advertise your website. Every website is different so each technique will vary in its effectiveness however each one should be explored as it could just be the one that makes your website a roaring success.  </p>
