Therefore, bounce rate demonstrates the quality of your web traffic. So, how do you plan to reduce the bounce rate of your website? The following are some ways reduce the bounce rate of your website by making visitors spend more times on your website:

<h2>1. Select an easily legible font size</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
The population in most of the developed nations is getting older. In addition, majority of the people work in front of computers all day. They do not want to stare closely at a web page to figure out what is written on it. As a result, the font size of your web content should be fairly large. Fairly large font size surely makes visitors spend more time reading content of your web page.

<h2>2. Make your visitors leave a comment</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
Whenever visitors leave comments on your website, they are either redirected to another web page or the web page refreshes. It means that they have visited more than one page of your website and your bounce rate has decreased.

<h2>3. Make your visitor subscribe to your website</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
When visitors subscribe to your website, they are usually redirected to a “Thank you” or any similar web page, and thus visit more than one page of your website. A visitor subscription help you create an e-mail list of visitors and decreases your bounce rate.

<h2>4. Make your 404 pages attractive and useful</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
Whenever visitors land on a 404 page of your website, redirect them to a relevant web page within your website or offer them some links to get the desired information. Simply do not let them go in a hurry elsewhere for that information.

<h2>5. Include “About” page</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
After the “Home” page of a website, “About” page attracts most visitors. You should ensure that there is an “About” page in the top navigation bar of your website.

<h2>6. Keep the layout and design of website clean</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
The look of your website goes a long way in determining whether visitors will stay on the website for long time or leave it quickly. Avoid featuring many sidebars, social media widgets, and advertisements on your website. A professional and uncluttered design will surely make your visitors spend more time on the website.

<h2>7. Decrease loading speed for your website</h2>
<div class="dev"><div class="dev_in"></div></div>
No visitor wants to wait for longer time for a web page to load. A slow loading rate substantially increases bounces rate. To ensure that your website does not ward off visitors, ensure that the website loads in short time.

The bounce rate shows the user engagement with your website. It also demonstrates your website’s ability to retain visitors for longer time. The intention of creating a website is to make people read the information presented on that website. Therefore you should make all possible efforts to keep the bounce rate for your website as low as possible.
