Of course, all of this will have to come within a budget the works for you.

Before you actually pay for any web hosting services, keep in mind there are quite a few free ones out there that you can consider. However, if professionalism is what you are looking at, then a paid web hosting service is your best bet. Assess your needs. If you are hosting a static website, then all you need is a small amount of space on a secure linux-based web hosting service. However, if your site is going to be more dynamic, then you have to consider the amount of storage space you require. 

Small dynamic sites may not need more than 2-3 GB, but if you are expecting high traffic on the site with a serious amount of uploads and downloads, then you have to factor in bandwidth. Bandwidth refers simply to the amount of data you plan to upload or download in a month. If you have heavy videos that you share, and opt for a 50GB bandwidth, then that is all that your server will allow you and your user to upload/download in a month. If such heavy data forms the base of your site, look into how much bandwidth you will need.

As the owner of your domain, you should be able to create and upload pages to your site from any location and this can only be done with FTP access. Ask your provider about the scale of FPT that is provided. This is a mandatory feature, no matter how new your site is; it goes a long way in ensuring that expansion is factored in. 

As you expand, you may feel the need to add sub-domains to your site. If you have not done your research to begin with, you will find that your host has a restriction on the number of sub-domains you can create. To make sure you donâ€™t have this problem, plan for expansion and check with your provider. 

You will need technical support available to you around the clock. Well-established domain providers have a number of communication options, and you can choose the one most convenient to you.
