excerpt: Creating custom shape in photoshop is relatively easy task, but what if you
  want to create it using multiple elements? This tutorial explains very easy technique
  to accomplish this task. We could use Illustrator to create such a thing, but I
  thought it would be interesting to make it in photoshop.
