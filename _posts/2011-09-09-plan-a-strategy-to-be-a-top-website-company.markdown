Recently there is news on Google that Google desktop will soon discontinue. It will no longer be available from 14th September. Google desktop has 10millions of users for whom it is being updated. But Google has come up with a better solution for Notebook. It will be providing a collaborative tool that will share and publish URL’s. When it gets shut "in the coming months" data will automatically be transferred to Google Docs. The main reason behind discontinuing the product is because of web security. 

Michael Hartzell, inbound marketing guru has come up with a new concept and has announced that $100 discount will be provided on 20th September to build website. The main purpose of the event is to provide an opportunity to the entrepreneurs to create an effective website with limited means within a few hours. For the entire event the offer is only $265. Hartzell claims that some of the Top Website Company provides at a much more price than $265 but Hartzell will be providing at a lesser price. To establish a company requires hard work and dedication and the right implementation of the marketing strategy in order to survive in the market.
